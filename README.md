# A portfolio for an architect

## TODO

- The scroll down button is clickable, even though it's invisible
- You have to scroll to see the footer in 404 page, also add nice bg to 404 page
- maybe use `window.requestAnimationFrame` to throttle checking inside navbar // [ reference ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/scroll_event#examples)
- fix event listener leakage in Navbar's show hook
- add tab focus for elements
- hide sidebar on route change
